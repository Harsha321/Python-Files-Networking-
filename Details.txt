##I am a beginner in Python. I am working on Python for my final project. 
My final Masters Project is entirely based on python. So I am concentarting more on it and learning more and more.
Also I am currently working on "SDN Approach for Mitigating DDOS Attacks"  using "pox controller". 
This pox controller has to be designed in Python. 


##I did Data Scientist Tool kit course on coursera which explains the use of Git and github. 
I learned using git from this course. I liked it and I am planning to upload all my Masters projects onto it.


##I am good at networking. 
There are many concepts in networking for a any student to learn in depth and I am learning it as much as I can. 
I always likes to revise them.


##It took me entire weekend with two sleepless nights to complete these programs. 
I tried my level best and worked on this assignment.

## In my Internetworking course I have configured VLANs on switches in cisco lab
Also I have configured OSPF area parameters over serial interfaces.
It took me time for understading python inbuit libraries and APIs so due to lack of time still knowing how to configure 
switches and ospf, I was unable to complete last program.
